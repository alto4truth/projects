# Review: "The Algorithm"

**Rating: 3/5 stars**

This tech thriller examines the dark side of artificial intelligence and social media manipulation. The premise is timely and relevant, but the execution feels derivative of better films in the genre.

The film raises important questions about privacy and algorithmic bias, but never fully commits to exploring these themes deeply. The action sequences are competently directed but lack the tension needed to elevate the material.

**Strengths:**
- Relevant social commentary
- Strong technical execution
- Timely subject matter

**Weaknesses:**
- Predictable plot structure
- Underdeveloped characters
- Missed opportunities for deeper exploration

**Verdict:** A decent thriller that fails to reach its potential. Worth watching for its topical relevance, but don't expect to be blown away.
