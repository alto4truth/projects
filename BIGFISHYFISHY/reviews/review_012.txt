# Review: "Neon Nights"

**Rating: 3/5 stars**

This neo-noir set in a futuristic city follows a detective investigating a series of crimes that may be connected to an experimental memory modification technology. The film has style to spare but lacks substance.

The visual design is striking, with neon-lit streets and cyberpunk aesthetics that evoke classic sci-fi films. However, the plot becomes increasingly convoluted, and the characters feel like archetypes rather than real people.

**Strengths:**
- Impressive visual design and atmosphere
- Strong technical execution
- Compelling world-building

**Weaknesses:**
- Confusing and ultimately unsatisfying plot
- Shallow character development
- Style over substance approach

**Verdict:** A stylish but ultimately hollow experience that prioritizes aesthetics over storytelling. Good for fans of visual style, but disappointing for those seeking narrative depth.
