# Review: "The Last Dance"

**Rating: 3.5/5 stars**

This sports drama follows a retired ballet dancer who takes a teaching position at a struggling arts school. The film explores themes of artistic legacy, mentorship, and the cost of pursuing one's passion.

The choreography is beautiful and serves the story effectively. The lead performance captures both the character's artistic brilliance and personal struggles. However, some of the supporting characters feel underdeveloped.

**Strengths:**
- Beautiful dance sequences
- Strong lead performance
- Authentic portrayal of the arts community

**Weaknesses:**
- Predictable plot structure
- Some supporting characters lack depth
- Conventional resolution

**Verdict:** A solid drama that celebrates the power of art to transform lives. Worth watching for the dance sequences and the central performance, even if the story is familiar.
