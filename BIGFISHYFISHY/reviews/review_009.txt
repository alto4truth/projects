# Review: "Steel and Silk"

**Rating: 3.5/5 stars**

This period drama set in 1920s Shanghai follows a seamstress who becomes involved in the city's underground resistance movement. The film combines historical drama with espionage thriller elements, though not always successfully.

The costume design is exceptional, and the production values are high throughout. The action sequences are well-choreographed, but the romantic subplot feels underdeveloped.

**Strengths:**
- Stunning period detail and costumes
- Strong action sequences
- Atmospheric cinematography

**Weaknesses:**
- Uneven tone between drama and thriller elements
- Romantic subplot lacks depth
- Some historical liberties taken

**Verdict:** A visually impressive film that doesn't quite balance its multiple genres. Worth watching for the craftsmanship, even if the storytelling is inconsistent.
