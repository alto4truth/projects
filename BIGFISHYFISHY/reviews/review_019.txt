# Review: "The Memory Palace"

**Rating: 3.5/5 stars**

This experimental drama follows a woman with hyperthymesia who can remember every detail of her life but struggles to form meaningful connections with others. The film explores the burden of perfect memory and the importance of forgetting.

The narrative structure mirrors the protagonist's condition, jumping between different time periods with seamless transitions. The concept is fascinating, though the execution occasionally becomes too cerebral.

**Strengths:**
- Innovative narrative structure
- Interesting exploration of memory and identity
- Strong technical execution

**Weaknesses:**
- Can feel cold and distant
- Some viewers may struggle with the non-linear structure
- Limited emotional connection to characters

**Verdict:** An ambitious, intellectually engaging film that doesn't always connect emotionally. Worth watching for its unique approach to storytelling and themes.
