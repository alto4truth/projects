# Review: "Quantum Hearts"

**Rating: 4/5 stars**

This romantic sci-fi explores love across parallel universes where every choice creates a different reality. The concept is ambitious, but the film grounds its high-concept premise in genuine human emotion.

The visual effects are stunning without being overwhelming, and the dual performances by the lead actors (playing multiple versions of their characters) are remarkable. The script balances scientific concepts with accessible storytelling.

**Strengths:**
- Innovative concept executed well
- Strong lead performances
- Beautiful practical effects

**Weaknesses:**
- Some plot threads left unresolved
- Science occasionally gets in the way of emotion

**Verdict:** A thoughtful exploration of love and choice that rewards viewers willing to embrace its complexity. Perfect for fans of intelligent sci-fi romance.
