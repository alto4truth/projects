# Review: "The Space Between Us"

**Rating: 4.5/5 stars**

This intimate sci-fi drama explores what it means to be human through the story of an astronaut who returns from a long-term space mission to find Earth fundamentally changed. The film is contemplative and philosophical without being pretentious.

The special effects are subtle and grounded, serving the story rather than overwhelming it. The lead performance is nuanced and compelling, conveying the disorientation of someone caught between worlds.

**Strengths:**
- Thoughtful exploration of human identity
- Subtle, effective special effects
- Strong, introspective performance

**Weaknesses:**
- Pacing may be too slow for some viewers
- Limited supporting character development

**Verdict:** A meditative sci-fi experience that prioritizes character and ideas over spectacle. Ideal for viewers who appreciate cerebral science fiction.
