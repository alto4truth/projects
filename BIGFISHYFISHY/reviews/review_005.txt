# Review: "The Forgotten Village"

**Rating: 3.5/5 stars**

This historical drama follows an anthropologist who discovers a remote village that seems to exist outside of time. The film builds atmosphere masterfully, creating a sense of unease that permeates every frame.

The production design is impeccable, and the cinematography captures both the beauty and strangeness of this isolated community. However, the third act loses focus, with the resolution feeling somewhat rushed.

**Strengths:**
- Exceptional atmosphere and mood
- Strong production values
- Intriguing premise

**Weaknesses:**
- Uneven pacing
- Underdeveloped supporting characters
- Disappointing conclusion

**Verdict:** A beautifully crafted film that doesn't quite stick the landing. Worth watching for the journey, even if the destination disappoints.
