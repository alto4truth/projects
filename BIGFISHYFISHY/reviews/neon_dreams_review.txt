# Review: "Neon Dreams"

**Rating: 3/5 stars**

This cyberpunk thriller has style to spare but substance in short supply. The neon-soaked visuals are stunning, and the world-building is impressive, but the plot feels familiar and underdeveloped.

The action sequences are well-choreographed, and the sound design creates an immersive atmosphere. However, the characters feel like archetypes rather than real people.

**Strengths:**
- Outstanding visual design
- Strong technical execution
- Compelling world-building

**Weaknesses:**
- Predictable plot
- Shallow character development
- Over-reliance on style over substance

**Verdict:** A visually striking film that fails to deliver on its promising premise. Good for sci-fi fans who prioritize aesthetics over narrative depth.
