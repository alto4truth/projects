# Review: "The Invisible Man"

**Rating: 3/5 stars**

This psychological thriller follows a woman who believes her abusive ex-boyfriend has found a way to make himself invisible. The film explores themes of gaslighting, trauma, and the ways abusers maintain control over their victims.

The concept is compelling, and the film effectively builds tension through what the protagonist can see and what others cannot. However, the third act becomes过于 predictable, and the resolution feels somewhat unsatisfying.

**Strengths:**
- Strong exploration of psychological abuse
- Effective use of invisibility as metaphor
- Compelling lead performance

**Weaknesses:**
- Predictable third act
- Some plot holes in the invisibility concept
- Underdeveloped supporting characters

**Verdict:** A solid thriller with important themes that doesn't quite reach its full potential. Worth watching for the strong central performance and social commentary.
