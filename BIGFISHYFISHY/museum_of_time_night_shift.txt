# The Night Shift at the Museum of Time

Marcus worked the night shift at the Museum of Time, where every artifact told a story of when and where. The clocks throughout the building ticked at different speeds - some fast-forwarding toward tomorrow, others rewinding to yesterday.

His job was simple: walk the halls, ensure the exhibits were secure, and listen to the whispers of time itself. The ancient sundial in the Egyptian wing spoke of pharaohs and pyramids. The pocket watch from 1847 hummed with the energy of the industrial revolution. The digital clock from 1999 glitched and flickered, caught between centuries.

But Marcus's favorite exhibit was the Temporal Mirror - a reflective surface that showed not your current reflection, but glimpses of who you might become or who you used to be. Each night, he would stand before it, watching alternate versions of himself: the Marcus who had become a teacher, the one who had traveled the world, the one who had never left his hometown.

One night, as he gazed into the mirror, he saw not an alternate self, but his future self - older, wiser, standing in the same museum but with a different expression. The older Marcus smiled and mouthed a single word: "Stay."

Marcus understood then that his night shift wasn't just a job - it was his calling. He was the guardian of time itself, ensuring that past, present, and future remained connected. And in that moment, he knew he had found where he belonged.
