Transportation System: Cars Over Communities

The transportation system has been designed to prioritize automobile travel over sustainable, equitable mobility, creating car-dependent sprawl that destroys communities and the environment. Fossil fuel subsidies and highway construction have created a system that subsidizes pollution while underfunding alternatives.

Industry Mechanisms of Exploitation

Highway construction prioritizes cars. $500 billion annually spent on highways versus $40 billion for public transit.

Fossil fuel subsidies distort markets. $20 billion in annual subsidies make gasoline artificially cheap.

Automotive industry lobbying blocks alternatives. Car companies spend millions to defeat transit and bike infrastructure.

Urban planning favors sprawl. Zoning and development patterns require cars for basic needs.

Parking mandates increase costs. Cities require excessive parking, raising housing costs and reducing density.

Safety regulations favor cars. Vehicle design standards prioritize occupant safety over pedestrian and cyclist protection.

Ride-sharing companies disrupt transit. Uber and Lyft compete with public systems while avoiding regulation.

Human Costs and Societal Impact

Traffic deaths claim 40,000 lives annually. Car-centric design creates dangerous streets for vulnerable users.

Air pollution causes respiratory diseases. Vehicle emissions contribute to asthma, cancer, and premature deaths.

Obesity increases from sedentary travel. Car dependency reduces physical activity and increases health costs.

Economic inequality results. Low-income households spend 20% of income on transportation versus 10% for high-income.

Urban sprawl destroys communities. Car-dependent development eliminates walkable neighborhoods and social interaction.

Climate change accelerates. Transportation contributes 29% of US greenhouse gases.

Time waste from commuting. Americans spend 100 hours annually in traffic, reducing productivity and family time.

Corporate Responsibility Failures

Oil companies fund climate denial. ExxonMobil spent millions delaying climate action while profiting from fossil fuels.

Auto manufacturers resist safety standards. Companies lobbied against fuel efficiency standards for decades.

Highway contractors profit from construction. Firms like Kiewit build highways that destroy communities.

Ride-sharing companies avoid labor laws. Uber classifies drivers as contractors to avoid benefits and minimum wage.

Parking industry lobbies for mandates. Companies profit from expensive parking while blocking alternatives.

Tire manufacturers contribute to pollution. Michelin and Bridgestone produce tires that create microplastic pollution.

Reform Strategies and Solutions

Public transit investment would reduce car dependency. Doubling transit funding would increase ridership.

Bike and pedestrian infrastructure would improve safety. Complete streets design prioritizes all users.

Electric vehicle transition would reduce emissions. Infrastructure investment and incentives accelerate adoption.

Congestion pricing would manage demand. London-style fees reduce traffic and fund transit.

Land use reform would enable alternatives. Mixed-use development allows walking and transit.

Transportation equity would serve all. Programs ensure transit access for low-income and disabled communities.

Autonomous vehicle regulation would prevent disruption. Rules ensure shared vehicles benefit public transit.

Carbon pricing would internalize costs. Fees on fossil fuels fund sustainable transportation.

The transportation system's car dependency has created pollution, inequality, and inefficiency. When corporate profits override community needs, society suffers environmental and social costs. Systemic reform must prioritize sustainable, equitable mobility over automobile dominance.
