THE SUGAR CHILDREN: INNOCENTS ENSLAVED BY THE WHITE DEATH

In the darkest corners of the sugar apocalypse, where the white death had consumed entire generations, a new horror emerged. The sugar industry had discovered how to create sugar children - infants and toddlers whose minds were permanently altered by sugar compounds, turning them into perfect little consumers who knew nothing but the need for white death. This is the story of the sugar children and their parents' desperate fight to save what remained of childhood innocence.
