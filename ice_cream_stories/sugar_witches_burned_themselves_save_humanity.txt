THE SUGAR WITCHES: WOMEN WHO BURNED THEMSELVES TO SAVE HUMANITY

In the darkest hours of the sugar apocalypse, when the white death had consumed most of the world and natural food had been nearly eliminated, a group of women emerged from the shadows. They called themselves the Sugar Witches - scientists, doctors, farmers, and mothers who chose to burn themselves alive rather than surrender to the sugar industry's demands. This is their story, and the story of how their sacrifice saved what remained of humanity.
