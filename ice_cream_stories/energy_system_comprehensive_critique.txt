Energy System: Fossil Fuels Over Future Generations

The energy system remains dominated by fossil fuels despite renewable alternatives, creating environmental destruction and climate catastrophe while enriching corporations. Subsidies and infrastructure lock in dirty energy while blocking clean transitions that could power a sustainable future.

Industry Mechanisms of Exploitation

Fossil fuel subsidies distort markets. $7 trillion in annual global subsidies make coal, oil, and gas artificially cheap.

Nuclear energy receives preferential treatment. Government backing provides liability protection and waste management.

Renewable energy faces barriers. Grid interconnection costs and permitting delays prevent solar and wind deployment.

Infrastructure lock-in maintains status quo. Existing pipelines and power plants create path dependency.

Regulatory capture influences policy. Energy companies fund campaigns against climate action.

Price manipulation affects consumers. Utilities charge higher rates while receiving subsidies.

Technology suppression blocks innovation. Patents and acquisitions prevent clean energy competition.

Human Costs and Societal Impact

Climate change threatens civilization. Fossil fuels contribute 75% of energy emissions, causing extreme weather and sea level rise.

Air pollution causes premature deaths. 7 million annual deaths from fossil fuel particulates and ozone.

Health costs burden society. Pollution-related illnesses cost $800 billion annually in medical care.

Economic inequality results. Low-income communities suffer higher pollution exposure and energy costs.

Environmental destruction occurs. Oil spills, mountaintop removal, and fracking contaminate land and water.

Energy poverty affects millions. 840 million lack electricity while others pay exorbitant rates.

Resource wars create conflict. Competition for fossil fuels fuels international tensions.

Corporate Responsibility Failures

ExxonMobil funds climate denial. The company knew of climate science for decades but misled the public.

Chevron causes environmental disasters. The company faced fines for Ecuador oil spills and California refinery fires.

Duke Energy profits from coal. The utility fights renewable transition while receiving subsidies.

Nuclear industry lobbies for expansion. Companies like Westinghouse build plants with cost overruns and safety risks.

Oil companies oppose renewables. Shell and BP invest in fossil fuels while greenwashing.

Utilities resist grid modernization. Monopolies block rooftop solar and community choice aggregation.

Reform Strategies and Solutions

Fossil fuel subsidy elimination would level playing field. Redirecting subsidies to renewables accelerates transition.

Renewable portfolio standards would mandate clean energy. 100% renewable targets by 2035 are achievable.

Grid modernization would enable distributed energy. Smart grids and storage support solar and wind.

Energy efficiency programs would reduce demand. Building retrofits and appliance standards cut consumption.

Nuclear phase-out would eliminate risks. Investing in renewables rather than new reactors.

Community choice aggregation would democratize energy. Local governments procure clean power for residents.

Carbon pricing would internalize costs. Taxes on emissions fund clean energy development.

Research investment would drive innovation. Public funding for battery storage and grid technology.

The energy system's fossil fuel dominance threatens planetary survival. When corporate profits override climate science, future generations pay the ultimate cost. Systemic transformation to clean, equitable energy is essential for human and environmental health.
