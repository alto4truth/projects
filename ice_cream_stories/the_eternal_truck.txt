THE ICE CREAM TRUCK THAT NEVER STOPPED

The ice cream truck had been driving down Maple Street for three days straight. 

Mrs. Henderson first noticed it Tuesday morning at 7:23 AM. The same cheerful melody, the same faded "Best Ice Cream in Town" sign, the same driver who never seemed to age. By Wednesday evening, the entire neighborhood had called the police.

"It's been playing the same song for 72 hours straight," complained Mr. Peterson. "My dog hasn't stopped howling."

Officer Martinez arrived to find the truck parked perfectly in the middle of the street, engine running, music box playing "Turkey in the Straw" on an endless loop. But when he approached the driver's window, he found only empty seats and melting ice cream.

The truck was full of every flavor imaginable: rocky road with nuts that whispered secrets, vanilla that tasted like forgotten birthdays, chocolate that showed you visions of your deepest desires. But there was no driver, no source of the music, no explanation for how it kept moving down the street.

Children tried to buy ice cream, holding up crumpled dollar bills, but no one appeared to serve them. The truck just kept driving, playing its endless song, leaving a trail of melted sweetness and confused neighbors.

By Friday, the truck had circled the block 847 times. The ice cream was still perfectly preserved inside its glass display case, never melting despite the summer heat. The music never stopped, never changed key, never varied in tempo.

Mrs. Chen, a retired physics professor, finally figured it out. "It's not a time loop," she announced to the gathered crowd. "It's a space loop. The truck exists in a bubble of compressed time and space. For us, it's been three days. For the truck, it's been three minutes."

But that raised an even more disturbing question: Where was the driver? And more importantly, where had he been for the past three days, trapped in his own personal hell of endless music and endless driving?

The truck finally stopped on Sunday morning. The music cut off mid-note, the engine died, and the ice cream began to melt for the first time in days. 

When the police opened the door, they found the driver inside, perfectly preserved like the ice cream, a look of eternal contentment on his face. He had been dead for three days, but his hands still gripped the steering wheel, his eyes still stared ahead at the endless road.

The ice cream truck was towed away, but sometimes, late at night, neighbors swear they can still hear that faint melody drifting through the streets. And sometimes, just sometimes, they see a truck driving down Maple Street, playing the same song, with no driver at all.

The ice cream truck that never stopped had found its final customer: eternity itself.
