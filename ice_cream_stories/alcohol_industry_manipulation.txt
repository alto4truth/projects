Alcohol Industry Manipulation: Normalizing Addiction for Profit

The alcohol industry manipulates culture and policy to normalize excessive drinking, resisting regulations while profiting from addiction and health harms. Marketing campaigns and lobbying create a system where alcohol consumption is socially mandated despite causing 140,000 annual deaths.
